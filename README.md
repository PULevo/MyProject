---

A lightweight SaaS-style web application designed for **small teams (1–10 users)** to manage projects and tasks efficiently.

This project is built as a **full-stack portfolio application** using:

- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- React / Next.js (planned)

The goal is to demonstrate:

- Production-level backend architecture  
- Secure authentication  
- Proper database design  
- Scalable SaaS-ready structure  

---

# Current Status

Backend is **feature-complete for the MVP scope**.  

All core functionality — authentication, organization management, project management, and task management — has been implemented and is covered by automated tests.

---

## Implemented

- FastAPI backend with modular architecture  
- PostgreSQL integration via SQLAlchemy  
- Alembic migration system  
- User model (email, hashed password, name, timestamps)  
- User registration: `POST /users/register`  
- JWT-based login: `POST /auth/login`  
- Current user endpoint: `GET /users/me`  
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)  
- Organization management (roles: admin / member)  
- Project management per organization  
- Task management per project  
- Role-based access control  
- Automated tests with pytest  
- Docker Compose for local PostgreSQL  

---

## In Progress / Planned

- Frontend (React / Next.js)  
- Cloud deployment  
- Production hardening  

---

# Project Vision

Build a **production-ready task management system** for small teams.

### Key Goals

- Clean and scalable backend architecture  
- Proper database modeling and migrations  
- Secure authentication & RBAC  
- SaaS-ready multi-organization structure  
- Production-quality codebase suitable for portfolio and real-world use  

---

# MVP Scope (v1)

## Authentication 

- User registration  
- User login  
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)  
- JWT-based authentication  
- Current user endpoint (`GET /users/me`)  

---

## Organization Management

- Create organization (creator becomes admin)  
- List own organizations  
- List organization members  
- Add member (admin only)  
- Remove member (admin only)  
- Role-based access (admin / member)  

---

##  Project Management 

- Create project per organization (admin only)  
- List organization projects (member+)  
- Get single project (member+)  
- Update project (admin only)  
- Delete project (admin only, requires no tasks)  

---

##  Task Management 

- Create task (member+)  
- List tasks (member+)  
- Get single task (member+)  
- Update task (member+)  
- Delete task (creator or admin)  
- Task statuses: `todo` / `doing` / `done`  
- Optional user assignment  

---

##  Views (Frontend — Planned)

- My Tasks view  
- Project task list view  

---

#  Future Features (v2+)

- Comments on tasks  
- File attachments  
- Email invitations  
- Notifications  
- Activity logs  
- Billing and subscriptions  
- Analytics dashboard  
- API integrations  
- AI-assisted features

### Architecture Principles

- Modular structure with clear separation of concerns  
- Router → Schema → CRUD → Model layering  
- Dependency injection for DB sessions & authentication  
- Migration-based database management via Alembic
